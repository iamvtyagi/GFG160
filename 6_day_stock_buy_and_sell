problem statement:- The cost of stock on each day is given in an array price[]. Each day you may decide to either buy or sell the stock at price[i], you can even buy and sell the stock on the same day. Find the maximum profit that you can get.
Note: A stock can only be sold if it has been bought previously and multiple stocks cannot be held on any given day.

code :- 
        int maximumProfit(vector<int> &prices) {
        // code here
        int n  = prices.size();
        int profit = 0;
        if(n > 0 ){
            int min = prices[0];
        }
        for(int i =0 ; i<n-1;i++){
            
            if(prices[i]<prices[i+1]){
                profit += prices[i+1] - prices[i]; 
            
        }
     
      }
        
        return profit;
        
    }
