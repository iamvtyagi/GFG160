problem statement :- Given a positive integer k and an array arr[] denoting heights of towers, you have to modify the height of each tower either by increasing or decreasing them by k only once.
Find out what could be the possible minimum difference of the height of shortest and longest towers after you have modified each tower.
Note: A slight modification of the problem can be found here. 

code :-  int getMinDiff(int k, vector<int> &arr) {
        // code here
          int n =arr.size();
        if(n==1){
            return 0;
        }
        sort(arr.begin(),arr.end());
        int ans = arr[n-1] - arr[0];
        
        for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
            // if(arr[i] < k) continue;
            
            int minHeight = min(arr[0] + k, arr[i] -k );
            int maxHeight = max(arr[n-1] -k, arr[i-1]+k);
            
            ans = min(ans,maxHeight - minHeight);
        }
        return ans;
    }
